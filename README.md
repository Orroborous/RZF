Analytical research inspired by ROBERT J. LEMKE OLIVER AND KANNAN SOUNDARARAJAN, "UNEXPECTED BIASES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF CONSECUTIVE
PRIMES" [2016]. https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03720v4 and Chebyshev's Bias [1853] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev's_bias.  

## Algo

This algorithm attempts to generate visual multiway systems via python/networkx. These multiway systems are created by taking a starting number, n, and apply different rules depending on whether n is odd or even. After the transformation, the output of the function is inputted recursively, until the function terminates or expands to infinity. The most famous of such applications is the Collatz Conjecture  [1937]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture.

The original conjecture, otherwise known as the 3n+1 problem, has been an unsolved puzzle in mathematics. If n is even, the number is halved, and if n is odd, it is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. In all cases of positive n, the function eventually terminates to 1.

This conjecture can be demonstrated as a directed graph (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph). The figure below is a Directed Graph of all starting positive integers that terminate to 1 in less than 20 steps.

Directed Graphs of the Collatz Conjecture can also be generated in reverse. This also allows for starting inputs that are not necessarily positive integers. When iterating on Complex numbers, these (now 3d) visual number trees often share characteristics with fractals and have associated Julia Sets https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set. It should be noted that this is a relatively new field of mathematics, but leads to interesting patterns that can be observed and modified. 

When the starting parameters of n/2 & 3n+1 are substituted for different rules in the Real plane, Directed Graphs generated in Python via NetworkX may appear to be well-ordered or nonwell-ordered. Well-ordered systems are consistent and display nicely presented 2d nets with logical progression between even and odd numbers. Nonwell-ordered may visually skip, jump, and often contain no pattern, even out to very large integers. 

It is not known what the relationship is between the rules that causes disorderly sets to appear. This algorithm attempts to demonstrate and classify the visual multiway systems generated by rules as well-ordered or non-well ordered with the help of ChatGPT and Mathematica.

Known well-ordered parameters

(1+x), 2x  
(1+2x),2x  
2+2x, 2x  
3x, 2x  
4x, 2x  
1+4x, 2x

Known nonwell-ordered parameters

(1+3x), 2x  
2+x, 2x  
2+3x, 2x  
3+3x, 2x    

It is believed that relationships between well ordered and nonwell-ordered multiway systems generated with Complex numbers may have bearing in proving nontrivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta Function [1853] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis.
